This assignment consists of two parts that scrapes information from websites about Mars, then cleans/manipulates and visually analyzes that information.

The first part scrapes articles about Mars and stores the article title and summary in a python list.

The second part scraps data regarding temperatures recorded on Mars from 2012-2018.  

This dataset was used to identify:
- the number of months on Mars
- the number of Martian days of data present in the scraped data

The following information is visually represented:
- the average coolest and warmest months on Mars
- the months with the highest and lowest atmospheric pressure
- a daily record of minimum temperatures for one Martian year in earth days.

Finally, the dataframe is exported as a CSV file.
